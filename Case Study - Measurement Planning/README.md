# Case Study - Measurement Planning

## The Situation

I have just landed a job as the first Business Intelligence Analyst working in the call center for Maven Muscles, a nationwide gym that helps people get in shape. The call center handles new signups and customer service.

## The Assignment

My first assignment is to build a detailed measurement plan for the VP who runs the call center. She reports to the COO and indirectly to the CEO, and oversees 5 Managers who each lead a team of call center reps.

## The Objectives

1. Consider the goals of the business and needs of the stakeholders
2. Identify and prioritize Key Performance Indicators and supporting metrics
3. Make a plan to gather the data and address any gaps

## The Deliverables

To complete the assignment and meet the objectives, I carried out the following steps to help identify the business and stakeholder goals.

## ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Think Business First

Prior to analyzing data it is important to first think as a business owner.

### 1. What are the high-level goals of the Maven Muscles business?

The high-level goals would be a combination of financial and customer-centric targets:

- Increase Revenue and Profit
- Increase customer count
- Increase customer satisfaction

### 2. How does the call center support those business goals?

To achieve the goals the call center would do the following:

- Provide offers to increase registered customers
- Reduce customer churn
- Enhance customer service

### 3. What are the most important goals for the call center?

- Increase signups
- Resolve customer issues quickly
- Keep customers happy

### 4. What questions should you try to answer for call center leadership?

The call center leadership would more likely be focused at employees and customer levels:
- The rate of new customer signups/churn of existing customers
- Employee turnover rate
- Staff workload assessment
- How long do customers have to wait to connect with call center employees
- Customer satisfaction sentiment

### 5. What actions can you imagine leadership taking based on your data?

- Introducing campaigns to attract customers
- Identifying what services to improve
- Providing incentives to employees based on performance
- Identifying problems

## ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Know your audience

The next step is to focus on the key stakeholders; who are they, what do they need, and how will the analysis support them?

### 1. What is your primary stakeholder most interested in? What are her goals?

- Customer retention
- New customer signups
- Customer satisfaction
- Call center performance


### 2. What information should you provide to help her do her job well?

- Dashboards consisting of above metrics
- Insights on low performing areas

### 3. What are the COO and CEO most interested in?

- Financial metrics (Profit, Revenue etc.)
- Reducing customer churn
- Identifying high value customers

### 4. What are the call center Managers most interested in?

- Employees meeting objectives
- Meeting customer satisfaction goals
- Team development

### 5. What information do Managers need to make their teams more effective?

- KPIs of employee performance
- Customer feedback comments regarding call center
- Identifying rate and cause of voluntary turnovers

## ðŸ“Œ Step 3: Define the KPIs

Upon defining the business impact and stakeholder needs, it is important to identify the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and supporting metrics to track progress towards the business outcomes.


## ðŸ“Œ Step 4: Identify data sources

After identifying the KPIs and supporting metrics, it is time to think about what data is needed, where to source it, and how to prepare it for analysis.
