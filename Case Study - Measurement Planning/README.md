# Case Study - Measurement Planning

## The Situation

I have just landed a job as the first Business Intelligence Analyst working in the call center for Maven Muscles, a nationwide gym that helps people get in shape. The call center handles new signups and customer service.

## The Assignment

My first assignment is to build a detailed measurement plan for the VP who runs the call center. She reports to the COO and indirectly to the CEO, and oversees 5 Managers who each lead a team of call center reps.

## The Objectives

1. Consider the goals of the business and needs of the stakeholders
2. Identify and prioritize Key Performance Indicators and supporting metrics
3. Make a plan to gather the data and address any gaps

## The Deliverables

To complete the assignment and meet the objectives, I carried out the following steps to help identify the business and stakeholder goals.

## ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Think Business First

Prior to analyzing data it is important to first think as a business owner.

### 1. What are the high-level goals of the Maven Muscles business?

The high-level goals would be a combination of financial and customer-centric targets:

- Increase Revenue and Profit
- Increase customer count
- Increase customer satisfaction

### 2. How does the call center support those business goals?

To achieve the goals the call center would do the following:

- Provide offers to increase registered customers
- Reduce customer churn
- Enhance customer service

### 3. What are the most important goals for the call center?

- Increase signups
- Resolve customer issues quickly
- Keep customers happy

### 4. What questions should you try to answer for call center leadership?

The call center leadership would more likely be focused at employees and customer levels:
- The rate of new customer signups/churn of existing customers
- Employee turnover rate
- Staff workload assessment
- How long do customers have to wait to connect with call center employees
- Customer satisfaction sentiment

### 5. What actions can you imagine leadership taking based on your data?

- Introducing campaigns to attract customers
- Identifying what services to improve
- Providing incentives to employees based on performance
- Identifying problems

## ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Know your audience

The next step is to focus on the key stakeholders; who are they, what do they need, and how will the analysis support them?

### 1. What is your primary stakeholder most interested in? What are her goals?



### 2. What information should you provide to help her do her job well?



### 3. What are the COO and CEO most interested in?



### 4. What are the call center Managers most interested in?



### 5. What information do Managers need to make their teams more effective?
