# Case Study - Measurement Planning

I have just landed a job as the first Business Intelligence Analyst working in the call center for Maven Muscles, a nationwide gym that helps people get in shape. The call center handles new signups and customer service.

My first assignment is to build a detailed measurement plan for the VP who runs the call center. She reports to the COO and indirectly to the CEO, and oversees 5 Managers who each lead a team of call center reps.

## The Objectives

1. Consider the goals of the business and needs of the stakeholders
2. Identify and prioritize Key Performance Indicators and supporting metrics
3. Make a plan to gather the data and address any gaps
