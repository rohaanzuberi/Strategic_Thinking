# Case Study - Measurement Planning

I have just landed a job as the first Business Intelligence Analyst working in the call center for Maven Muscles, a nationwide gym that helps people get in shape. The call center handles new signups and customer service.

## The Assignment

My first assignment is to build a detailed measurement plan for the VP who runs the call center. She reports to the COO and indirectly to the CEO, and oversees 5 Managers who each lead a team of call center reps.

## The Objectives

1. Consider the goals of the business and needs of the stakeholders
2. Identify and prioritize Key Performance Indicators and supporting metrics
3. Make a plan to gather the data and address any gaps

## The Deliverables

To complete the assignment and meet the objectives, I carried out the following steps.

To answer this question, it is important to consider 

2. How does the call center support those business goals?

4. What questions should you try to answer for call center leadership?



5. What actions can you imagine leadership taking based on your data?
