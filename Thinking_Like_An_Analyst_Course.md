# ðŸ’­ Thinking Like an Analyst

This file contains the key takeaways I had from the course offered by [Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/course/thinking-like-an-analyst).

The course contained information to help apply proven frameworks and practice the application of strategic thinking through case studies.

## ðŸ“Œ Key takeaways to be a great Analyst

Following are the core attributes required to be a great analyst:

### Strategic Thinking

Understanding business objectives or specific problems, identifies key success or failure factors, and developing concise, tactical analysis and measurement strategies are all aspects of strategic thinking.

Strategic Thinking is most critical at early stages of the analytics workflow


### Technical Proficiency

Technical Proficiency is the ability to execute. This is where **hard-skills** like writing code, carrying out ETL activities and data visualization matter.

Technical skills help in being effecient with analysis and being a valuable contributor to the analytical projects.

### Communication Skills

The ability to translate raw data to end users by communicating clearly. Additionally, it includes the ability to listen and interpret feedback effectively. 

## Data Analysis Workflow

Workflow to set clear expectations, define and measure key outcomes, improve accuracy and efficiency, and consistently deliver insightful, high-quality work:

### Understand the business case

- Think like a business owner
- Understand the specific outcomes you are trying to impact
- Understand who the key stakeholders are and what motivates them

 This will help aligning on requirements, project scope, and desired outcomes from day one.

> **KEY QUESTIONS**:
>
> - Which goals or business outcomes am I trying to impact?
> - Who are the key stakeholders, and how will this help them?
> - How does my work fit into the overall business strategy?

### Build a measurement plan

- It is a roadplan for success
- Defines what a successful outcome looks like for the business, determining which KPIs align with that outcome, and identifying the data needed to capture, track and optimize the metrics

 Critical step to deliver data-driven insights and outcomes

> **KEY QUESTIONS**:
>
> - What exactly does success look like for this analysis?
> - Which specific metrics will help me quantify success?
> - What data will I need to capture and track my KPIs?

### Collect & prepare the data

- Strong Data Quality = Strong Analysis
- Combination of quality assurance, data profiling, feature engineering, and ETL activities

Creates a strong foundation for analysis on clean, high-quality data

> **KEY QUESTIONS**:
>
> - Where is my data stored, and how can I access it?
> - Are there quality issues that need to be fixed?
> - Will I need to model or transform the data before analysis?

### Understand the data

- It is essential to understand the data before starting analysis
- Have crystal-clear understanding of the scope, granularity and composition of the source data
- Check if analysis requires some level of industry knowledge or domain expertise

This process will help in working efficiently and ensuring that the exact data needed to support analysis is available

> **KEY QUESTIONS**:
> 
> - What exactly does each record represent?
> - Which fields are most relevant to the analysis?
> - Are there important nuances or industry-specific metrics?

### Analyze & visualize the data

- It is about creating clear patterns and visual cues to help make sense of complex information

Allows data to be leveraged for story-telling data-driven narratives

> **KEY QUESTIONS**:
> 
> - What type of data am I trying to analyze or visualize?
> - What type of trend or pattern am I communicating?
> - Who is the end user consuming this information?

### Develop data-driven insights

- Role objective is not to analyze data; role objective is to deliver insights & outcomes for the business
- Strong insight = Data-driven story + Actionable recommendations to drive key outcomes in measurement plan

One of the most important step in workflow that should be prioritized.

> **KEY QUESTIONS**:
> 
> - What key takeaways are we able to derive from the data?
> - How can we use these insights to impact real outcomes?
> - How can I convince stakeholders to take action?

### Measure, test & optimize

- Track pre/post changes to your KPIs
- Quantify the impact of analysis outcomes (in dollars, if possible)
- Seek opportunities to continue to test and optimize

> **KEY QUESTIONS**:
> 
> - Did my recommendations produce the desired outcomes?
> - What value did this analysis generate for the business?
> - Can this analysis help inform future tests or optimizations?
