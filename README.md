## ðŸ“‘ Case Studies

| Case Study | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Measurement Planning](https://github.com/rohaanzuberi/Thinking_Like_an_Analyst/blob/83c91fce5a3ae408eb632c52886c69b94b44e8b2/Case%20Study%20-%20Measurement%20Planning/README.md) | Identifying the business impact, stakeholder requirements, metrics and data sources as a BI Analyst to help Maven Muscles' call centre  align with the business and stakeholder needs. |
| [Data Quality Assurance](Ongoing) | As a newly recruited Data Analyst for Maven Talent Hub, a firm that publishes email newsletters to subscribers looking for job insights and opportunities, I am required to aid the company in improving audience targeting and segmentation, which calls for analysis onÂ clean customer-level data. The company data that is currently accessible is a complete mess, thus the first objective is to QA the raw customer records to find any data quality issues that could potentially skew the analysis. |
