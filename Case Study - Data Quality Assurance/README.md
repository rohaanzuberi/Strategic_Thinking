# Case Study - Data Quality Assurance

## The Situation

I have been hired as a Data Analyst for Maven Talent Hub, a company that sends email newsletters to subscribers looking for job insights and opportunities.

## The Assignment

I am interested in analyzing customer-level data to help the company improve audience targeting and segmentation, but the data is a mess.

My task is to QA the raw customer records to identify any data quality issues that could potentially skew your analysis.

## The Objectives

1. Review a sample of user records exported from the companyâ€™s CRM platform
2. Identify any potential data quality concerns
3. Suggest a potential solution for each issue you encounter


## The Deliverables

Following is the sample raw data shared for carrying out QA checks.
